# KG Calculation Fix - Task Checklist

## Planning
- [x] Investigate data storage (benchmarks in `clients.details.oneRmStats`)
- [x] Trace KG calculation pipeline (`WorkoutBlockCard` → `useAthleteBenchmarks` → `getBenchmark`)
- [x] Add debug logging and deploy to production
- [x] Confirm root cause: `programClient` stays null in Zustand store
- [x] Create implementation plan

## Implementation
- [x] Add `setProgramClient` action to Zustand store (`lib/store/index.ts`)
- [x] Update `MesocycleEditor.tsx` `onAssignSuccess` to fetch full client and update store
- [x] Remove debug logging from `useAthleteBenchmarks.ts`

## Verification
- [x] Deploy changes to production
- [x] Browser test: assign athlete with benchmarks → KG appears ✅
- [x] Screenshot verification (75kg and 80kg calculated correctly from 100kg RM)

# Warmup UI Refactor - Task Checklist

## Implementation
- [x] Shrink "Rondas/Vueltas" input width (max-w-md)
- [x] Add "SERIES" input to GenericMovementForm
- [x] Reorganize movement grid to 4 columns (Series, Reps, Intensity, Rest)
- [x] Move Notes to full-width row below grid
- [x] Push changes to main

## Verification
- [x] Deploy changes to production
- [x] Browser verification: Login and check Warmup block UI ✅
- [x] Capture screenshots of verified state ✅
- [x] Confirm "Rondas" input is smaller ✅
- [x] Confirm "SERIES" input exists ✅
- [x] Confirm 4-column grid layout ✅
- [x] Confirm "Notas" below grid ✅

# Fix Athlete Registration Sync - Task Checklist

## Investigation
- [x] Analyze user registration flow and Supabase triggers
- [x] Identify why new athletes are not synced to athletes table (Missing client record creation)

## Implementation
- [x] Fix the synchronization logic (Migration to allow NULL coach_id and trigger update)
- [x] Verify fix with new user registration ✅
- [x] Backfill missing client records for existing users (Fixed 'Antonella Barone') ✅
